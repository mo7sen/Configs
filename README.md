<h1><code> My Super Cool Configs </code></h1>
</div>

I created this repository so that I do not need to rewrite my configs from scratch whenever I change device or OS (I just can't manage to not mess up a linux distro :D).

The configs I have so far in this repository are:

- editor
	- [nvim](editor/nvim)
